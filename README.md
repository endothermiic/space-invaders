# Space Invaders: Recreated 
This repository contains all code related to an implementation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders on an FPGA development board. Game graphics were displayed on a monitor using a VGA adapter, while FPGA buttons and switches were used for rocket control. On-chip RAM was used to store the current state (alive or dead) of all aliens and allowed the updated output (black if dead, the alien itself if alive) on the monitor.
